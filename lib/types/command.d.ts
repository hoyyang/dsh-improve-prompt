 * Slash-command splitting.

 * it is exactly the part worth enhancing: `/bugfix ISS-202607-00090605A 用户反馈
 * 填充后密码框清空…` has a command prefix and a paragraph of genuine content.
 *
 * This module is the single source of truth for that split: the host half uses it to
 * scope every gate to the body and to re-attach the prefix, the browser half uses it
 * only to decide whether there is anything to enhance.
