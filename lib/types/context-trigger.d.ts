 * - **anaphora** — a pronoun or continuation marker that points outside the draft.
 * - **short-vague** — a very short draft carrying no concrete fact (no path, URL,
 *   code, number, or file extension), e.g. "修一下" / "make it better".
 *
 * @param draft - the user's raw composer text.
 * @returns whether to attach context, and which signal fired.
