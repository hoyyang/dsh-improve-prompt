 * while the same 2.5x would refuse a nine-character draft the three-line rewrite it
 * most needs. Below {@link MIN_BUDGET_CHARS} characters the floor governs; above it
 * the mode's ratio governs. WorkBuddy's own positioning ("less filler, fewer
 * tokens", a flat ~800-character budget) is the same instinct.
